“GABRIEL Mermalt

On Easter morning in the year 1944, I took my six-year-old
son by the hand and began walking fron my home town toward the
valleys and forests of the Carpathian mountaing.. For nearly
eight months we lived in barns, attics and makeshift cabins. “ith
the HESEROS help of an unusually courageous man, we managed to
survive Europe's greatest fit of madness. Those who walked in
the opposite direction on that Easter day were less fortunate.
They were taken in trainloads to places whose once obscure names
are now, and forever will be, synonymous with terror, evil and
death. What follows is our story of survival told to the best
of my ability, in plain, simple language.

In March of 1944 the SS troops took over the internal affairs
of Hungary and proceeded to organize the éeportation of the Jews.
fo the Nazis this was a routine assignment; within hours all local
officials were informed of operational plans. The high command
issued a directive designed to placate Jewish fears and induce
cooperation. It was announced that the Jews would be shipped to
Poland as an emergency labor force and that they. were only being
drafted for temporary work. There were many who believed this
version. Others, less credulous, resigred themselves and hoped for
the best. Still others began to make plans for escape. By Apris
13 the Hungarian Jews were being rounded up from all over the
country in what was once a huge prick factory. The rest is well
known. .

I was working in Ungvar and usually came home on weekends.

At that time it was no longer possible for a Jew to travel freely.
